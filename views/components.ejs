    <h1>Learn about cars</h1>
    <h2>Engine</h2>
    <p>The engine is what powers the vehicles.</p>
    <h2>Pistons</h2>
    <p>The piston is a moving part of the combustion chamber. It is responsible for converting the energy released during the combustion process into mechanical work. The piston also performs a number of other important tasks: It seals the combustion chamber.</p>
    <h2>Block</h2>
    <p>An engine block - also known as a cylinder block - contains all of the major components where the combustion process takes place in a reciprocating engine.</p>
    <h2>Cylinder Head</h2>
    <p>The cylinder head forms the upper ceiling of the combustion chamber above each of the pistons, together with the spark plug sockets, and injector holders. </p>
    <h2>Crankshaft</h2>
    <p>An engine crankshaft runs inside the bottom end of a car's motor and converts the vertical movement of the pistons into horizontal rotational movement, which ultimately drives the wheels via the gearbox.</p>
    <h2>Rod Bearings</h2>
    <p>An engine rod bearing is a split-sleeve type of bearing that keeps the crankshaft and connecting rod in place as they rotate</p>
    <h2>Inlet Manifold</h2>
    <p>An inlet manifold or is the part of an internal combustion engine that supplies the fuel/air mixture to the cylinders.</p>
    <h2>Exhaust Manifold</h2>
    <p>The exhaust manifold is the first section of a vehicle's exhaust system. It funnels exhaust gases from all the cylinders and routes them to the car's catalytic converter.</p>
    <h2>Water Pump</h2>
    <p> Water pumps continually circulate coolant from the radiator to the vehicle's engine block to prevent overheating. Located at the front of the engine, the water pump is a vital part of an automobile's cooling system.</p>
    <h2>Oil Filter</h2>
    <p>The oil filter helps remove contaminants from your car engine's oil that can accumulate over time as the oil keeps your engine clean.</p>
    <h2>Oil Pump</h2>
    <p>The oil pump is an internal combustion engine part that circulates engine oil under pressure to the rotating bearings, the sliding pistons and the camshaft of the engine. This lubricates the bearings, allows the use of higher-capacity fluid bearings and also assists in cooling the engine.</p>
    <h2>Air Filter</h2>
    <p>An engine air filter in your car filters out dirt, debris, and other particles that could harm the engine. An engine air filter's purpose is to ensure only clean air enters a car's engine.</p>
    <h2>Gaskets</h2>
    <p>The main function of a car gasket is to act as an insulator between the cylinder block and the cylinder head. The purpose of the insulation is to prevent oil leakage so that oil will not enter the radiator channel or vice versa. The presence of a car gasket prevents oil from seeping into the combustion chamber.</p>
    <h2>Catalytic Coverter</h2>
    <p>A catalytic converter is fitted to the exhaust system of your car between the engine itself and the tips. It's there to reduce the number of harmful emissions coming out the other end of your exhaust system.</p>
    <h2>Propshaft</h2>
    <p>A component of the drive train in a vehicle, with the purpose of delivering torque from the transmission to the differential, which then transmits this torque to the wheels in order to move the vehicle.</p>
    <h2>Resonator</h2>
    <p>The resonator is a complement to the muffler in that it removes high-pitched noises along with annoying hums and buzzes. It creates a smoother exhaust note, but doesn't affect volume. The resonator is designed to eliminate sounds at a particular frequency which bounce off the inside of the device canceling each other.</p>
    <h2>Gearbox</h2>
    <p>A gearbox, also known as transmission, is a mechanical component that helps to transfer power from the engine to the wheels by using different gear ratios. It is usually located between the engine and the wheels, consisting of several gears, shafts and bearings.</p>
    <h2>Clutch</h2>
    <p>At its core, a car clutch is essentially a mechanical device that connects and disconnects the engine's power from the transmission, allowing you to change gears smoothly. It's an essential component of manual transmissions, serving as the intermediary between the engine and the wheels.</p>
    <h2>Backbox</h2>
    <P>The exhaust back box, which is a rear muffler, has the purpose to limit the sound generated by the gas as it passes through the exhaust system. It is located at the very end of the exhaust line and it is the most common muffler on cars.</P>
    <h2>Spark Plugs</h2>
    <p>Your spark plugs are what supply the spark that ignites the air/fuel mixture, creating the explosion which makes your engine produce power.</p>
    <h2>Coil Packs</h2>
    <p>A coil pack is a collection of ignition coils which act as a transformer, taking low voltage from the battery and giving it a boost so it can bridge the gap in a spark plug.</p>
    <h2>Timing Belt</h2>
    <p>Timing belt is one of the most important parts of a car's engine. It's responsible for keeping crucial parts of the motor working in sync with each other - making sure timing is accurate to ensure perfect running. Some cars have a timing chain instead of a belt.</p>
    <h2>Alternator</h2>
    <p>An alternator, as an integral part of every combustion engine vehicle, its main responsibility is to convert chemical energy to electrical energy so that you can charge and replenish the battery in your engine and other electrical components in a car.</p>
